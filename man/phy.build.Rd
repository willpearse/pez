\usage{
congeneric.merge(tree, species, split = "_", ...)

bind.replace(backbone, donor, replacing.tip.label, donor.length = NA)

congeneric.impute(tree, species, split = "_", max.iter = 1000, ...)

\arguments{
\item{tree}{\code{\link[ape:phylo]{phylo}} phylogeny to have those
species inserted into it}

\item{species}{vector of species names to be bound into the tree if
missing from it}

\item{split}{the character that splits genus and species names in
your phylogeny. Default is \code{_}, i.e. Quercus_robur.}

\item{...}{ignored}

\item{backbone}{backbone phylogeny (\code{\link[ape:phylo]{phylo}})
into which the donor is to be bound}

\item{donor}{phylogeny (\code{\link[ape:phylo]{phylo}}) to bound
into the backbone phylogeny}

\item{replacing.tip.label}{the species in the donor phylogeny
that's being replaced by the donor phylogeny}

\item{donor.length}{how deep the donor phylogeny should be cut into
the backbone phylogeny. If NA (default), then the bladj algorithm
is followed (or, in plain English, it's put half-way along the
branch)}

\item{max.iter}{Sometimes the random draw for the new branch length
to be added will be too large to allow it to be added to the
tree. In such cases, \text{congeneric.imput} will randomly draw
another branch length, and it will repeat this process
\code{max.iter} times. See 'notes' for more on this.}

\description{
Build a novel phylogeny from existing data

\code{congeneric.impute} sequentially add species to a phylogeny to
form an _imputed_ bifurcating tree. Makes use of a result from
Steel & Mooers (2010) that gives the expected branch-length under a
Yule model whether the rate of diversification has been
estimated. The intention of this is to approximate the method by
which phylogenetic structure is sampled from the prior in BEAST;
i.e., to approximate the standard Kuhn et al. (2011) method for
imputing a phylogeny. When using \code{congeneric.impute} you
should (1) repeat your analyses across many (if in doubt,
thousands) of separate runs (see Kuhn et al. 2011) and (2) check
for yourself that your trees are unbiased for your purpose - I make
no guarantee this is appropriate, and in many cases I think it
would not be. See also 'notes' below.

\details{
\code{congeneric.merge} Binds missing species into a
phylogeny by replacing all members of the clade it belongs to with
a polytomy. Assumes the \code{tip.labels} represent Latin
binomials, split by the \code{split} argument. This code was
originally shipped with phyloGenerator - this is the \code{merge}
method in that program.

\code{bind.replace} Binds a phylogeny (donor) into a
bigger phylogeny ('backbone'); useful if you're building a
phylogeny a la Phylomatic. A version of this R code was shipped
with phyloGenerator (Pearse & Purvis 2013). This is really an
internal function for \code{congeneric.merge}, but hopefully it's
of some use to you!
}
\note{
Thank you to Josep Padulles Cubino, who found that the genus
    name splitting in a previous version of this function could
    cause incorrect placement in oddly named cases. As with all
    phylogenetic construction tools, the output from
    \code{congeneric.merge} should be checked for accuracy before
    use.

Caveats for \text{congeneric.impute}: something I noticed is
    that BEAST randomly picks an edge to break when adding species
    (starting from a null tree), and this is the behaviour I have
    (attempted to) replicate here. It is not clear to me that this
    is unbiased, since a clade undergoing rapid diversification
    will have many edges but these will be short (and so cannot
    have an edge inserted into them following the method below). My
    understanding is this is a known problem, and I simply cannot
    think of a better way of doing this that doesn't incorporate
    what I consider to be worse pathology. Thus this method, even
    if it works (which I can't guarantee), it should tend to break
    long branches.
